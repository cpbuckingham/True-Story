# True Story
An app that makes it easy to get and give feedback during a retro, class, or presentation. 
“True Story” allows the users to anonymously interact with each other to provide impartial feedback. Retrospectives face issues with honesty, as employees are subject to telling people in the room what they WANT to hear as opposed to what they NEED to hear. This application will eliminate this issue by presenting a platform for anonymous interactions between engineers and project managers (or whoever may be using the app). Users will be able to login into the app as their respective position e.g. engineer, project manager, etc. and answer/ask questions using a yes and no button. The application allows for comments as well so that users can provide more specific feedback and aren’t limited to yes/no answers. The concept of this app is not exclusive to software development retrospectives and can find uses in other settings that need anonymous feedback and interactions like classrooms and presentations.
